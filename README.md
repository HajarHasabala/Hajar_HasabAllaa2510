# Energy Consumption Analysis Project
Overview
This project analyzes energy consumption data (water, electricity, and gas) for multiple buildings across different cities. Using SQL for data querying and Excel for visualization, it calculates total consumption, identifies trends, and computes costs based on yearly rates. The goal is to provide actionable insights for optimizing energy usage and reducing costs.
